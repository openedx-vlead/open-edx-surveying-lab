<h2>Principle</h2>
<p>It is based on the measurement of time for the distance travelled by wave</p>
<ul>
<li>Total Station Generates a beam that is sent to the prism and returned back</li>
<li>The Time-of-Flight is determined by the Total Station</li>
<li>Knowing the speed of light,the distance can be computed as-&nbsp;<br />Distance = Velocity x Time</li>
</ul>
