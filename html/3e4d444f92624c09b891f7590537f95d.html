<p>Dos:</p>
<ol>
<li>Center and level the base of Plane Table accurately.</li>
<li>Don't forget to orient the Plane Table with respect to magnetic north.</li>
<li>Always use good quality Drawing Sheet for mapping purpose.</li>
<li>Drawing Sheet must be firmly pasted on Plane Table to avoid any wrinkles.</li>
<li>Make a diagonal scale and use it for plotting the distances so as to compensate expansion or shrinkage of Drawing Sheet.</li>
<li>Bisect the ground object accurately using Alidade.</li>
<li>Measure the long distances with Clinometer and Clinopole observations, wherever possible.</li>
<li>This method is faster than Radiation Method but less accurate.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Don'ts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't waste too much of time to carryout exact centering of Plane Table, particularly in hilly area. It should be set close by within the plotting accuracy limit.</li>
<li>Ignore plotting the fields having dimensions less than the plotting accuracy.</li>
<li>Don't use this method in plain and small areas.</li>
</ol>
