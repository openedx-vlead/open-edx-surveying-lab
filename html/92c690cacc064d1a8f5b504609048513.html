<p>Dos:</p>
<ol>
<li>Center and level the base of Auto Level accurately.</li>
<li>Crosshairs must be focused sharply.</li>
<li>Keep the Backsight and Foresight distances nearly equal to compensate for collimation error, if any.</li>
<li>Always take 3 or more observations of each point to take the average.</li>
<li>In Fly Levelling, use Rise and Fall method for computation of RL's.</li>
<li>Apply checks after computing RL's.</li>
<li>Find closing error and distribute it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don'ts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Handle the Auto Level with utmost care. If dropped accidently, it may damage compensator and digital display.</li>
<li>If using aluminum staff, be away from electric poles, transformers and wires.</li>
<li>While shifting the instrument from one station to another station, always keep it in box for transport.</li>
<li>Protect the instrument from heavy rains.</li>
