<h1>Dos</h1>
<p>1. Always calibrate the GPS Receiver to a known benchmark.<br /> 2. Always take the observations when more than four satellites are tracked as it will give a better intersection.<br /> 3. Spend more than 5 minutes for observation on each point in order to have better mean value.<br /> 4. Use DGPS technique if higher accuracy of observation is desired.</p>
<h1>Don'ts</h1>
<p>1. Never take single observation of a point from GPS, as it may give incorrect reading.<br /> 2. Never keep the GPS instrument surrounded by high rise buildings, forest area etc., as these surrounding features will block the signals from satellites.</p>
