<h1>Dos and Don'ts Dos:</h1>
<br />1. Center and level the base of Plane Table accurately.<br /> 2. Don't forget to orient the Plane Table with respect to magnetic north. <br />3. Always use good quality Drawing Sheet for mapping purpose.<br /> 4. Drawing Sheet must be firmly pasted on Plane Table to avoid any wrinkles. <br />5. Make a diagonal scale and use it for plotting the distances so as to compensate expansion or shrinkage of Drawing Sheet.<br /> 6. Bisect the ground object accurately using Alidade.<br /> 7. Use this method when accurate positions of two or three control points are already known and plotted on Plane Table. <br />8. Three Point Problem is always preferred over Two Point Problem to get accurate position of ground point occupied by Plane Table. <br /> 9. Solve the Position of ground point inside the Great Triangle which is always preferred than outside Great Triangle. 10. Remember Lehmann's Rules to solve Three Point Problem quickly.
<h1>Don'ts:</h1>
<br /> 1. Don't waste too much of time to carryout exact centering of Plane Table, particularly in hilly area. It should be set close by within the plotting accuracy limit.<br /> 2. Ignore plotting the fields having dimensions less than the plotting accuracy. <br />3. Don't select three control points which make an acute or obtuse angle. <br />4. Don't set Plane Table close to one side of Great Triangle. <br />5. Do not disturb the centering or leveling of Plane Table during solving Three Point Problem using Trial and Error Method. If disturbed, repeat the process from beginning.</div>
